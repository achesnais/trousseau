# Trousseau

`[achesnais/trousseau "0.1.1"]`

Trousseau is a minimalist kitchensink library for Clojure.

- `trousseau.core` exposes a small set of useful functions like `map-vals` or `proportions`.
- `trousseau.time` provides an API for dealing with time in Clojure.

## Usage

### `trousseau.core`

`trousseau.core` was written with the explicit aim to be fully referred in namespaces, in the context of projects where functions like `map-vals` and `map-keys` are accepted as idiomatic.

```
(require '[trousseau.core :refer [map-vals]])
```

### `trousseau.time`
